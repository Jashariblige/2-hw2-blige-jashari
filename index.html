<h2> My Goals </h2>
<p>After finishing my Masters program I would love to work within the creative department for a professional sports team. I also have a huge goal to stay on top of my studies throughout the semester, while still being able to mangage a healthy study, work, and social balance. </p>

<h2>Things That make me happy </h2>
<p> When the weather cools off in Florida and it's brisk enough all day for a cardigain.</p>
<p>When it doesn't rain every day at 5pm and you can go for an evening walk</p>
<p>Almost anything except summer in Florida (it's way too hot for me haha) </p>
